# My Programming Journey

Welcome to my programming journey! This repository will serve as a journal of my progress as I learn and improve my web development skills.

## About This Repository

In this repository, I will be documenting my progress as I work through the course **"Kurs Tworzenia Stron WWW cz. I - HTML, CSS, RWD"** by Mateusz Maj. This course covers the basics of web development, focusing on HTML, CSS, and Responsive Web Design (RWD).

## Course Overview

- **HTML (HyperText Markup Language):** The foundation of web development, used to structure content on the web.
- **CSS (Cascading Style Sheets):** Used to style and layout web pages, making them visually appealing.
- **RWD (Responsive Web Design):** Techniques and practices to ensure that web pages look good on all devices, from desktops to mobile phones.

## Repository Structure

Each major topic will be placed in a separate folder. The name of each folder will reflect the topic being covered. Inside each topic folder, the `index.html` file will be located directly within the folder. Additionally, there will be a subfolder named `css/` that contains all the CSS styles used on the page.

Example structure:

- `basic_html/`: Contains lessons on basic HTML elements
  - `index.html`: Main HTML file for the basic HTML lessons
  - `css/`: Subfolder containing all CSS styles for the basic HTML lessons
    - `styles.css`: CSS file with styles for the basic HTML lessons

## Progress Updates

I will be regularly updating this repository with new projects, exercises, and any other work related to the course. Each update will be accompanied by a commit message describing the changes.
