# My Programming Journey

Welcome to my programming journey! This repository will serve as a journal of my progress as I learn and improve my web development skills.

## About This Repository

In this repository, I will be documenting my progress as I work through the course **"Kurs Tworzenia Stron WWW cz. I - HTML, CSS, RWD"** by Mateusz Maj. This course covers the basics of web development, focusing on HTML, CSS, and Responsive Web Design (RWD).
